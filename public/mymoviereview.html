        The movie has relatively fresh National School of Drama passed talents
        in this new segment of TV Films started in India in 80s. <br />If you
        have ears for a gripping script and excellent dialogue delivery and eyes
        for nuances in acting watch it!

        The movie has a trademark Priyadarshan stamp on it. <br />Lovely story,
        impeccable acting, and great dialogues in the sweet eastern UP dialects.
